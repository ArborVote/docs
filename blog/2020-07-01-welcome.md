Welcome to the ArborVote project!

The project started at the ETHLondon Hackathon in March 2020. 
The idea was to build decentralized debate platform for 
rational decision-making  based on quadratic voting in a tree of pro and con arguments.
This form of democratic decision making is known under the term 
[deliberative democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberative_democracy).

With the global challenges ahead, this is something the world needs right now. üåç<br/>
So let's be constructive and build a decentralized and democratic future together!
