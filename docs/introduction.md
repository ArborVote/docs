ArborVote is a module for rational decision-making based on arguments that can be used in DAPPs and DAOs. 

Decision-making based on arguments is unpopular because of the bureaucratic overhead connected to it.
The centralized online platform [kialo.com](https://www.kialo.com/) overcame this issue and keeps debates rational,
presents them in a structured and transparent way, and, thus,
allows for fast on-boarding of participants.
Participants create a tree of pro and con arguments and can express preference by rating their impact.
However, the platform cannot be used as a governance tool because it lacks resilience against manipulation and Sybil attacks.
This gap can be filled with blockchain technology by
- providing a tamper-proof voting infrastructure,
- using decentralized digital identities, and
- creating economic incentives for participation.

Here, we present a voting module for deliberative decision-making using argument trees that can be integrated into existing DApps and DAOs.
