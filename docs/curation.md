Curators can flag inappropriate arguments in the tree
to suggest removal or improvement.

## Removal
To suggest removal of an argument, curators have to make a deposit and 
explain the reason in text form.
If the author accepts the criticism and withdraws the argument, 
only a small part of the authors deposit will be paid to the curator.
In the other case, a dispute is opened and both risk losing their entire deposit in court if they lose the case.

Arguments that qualifies for removal may be/contain:
- **duplicates**, which create confusion and violates the ownership of the original author
- **spam**, which influences the decision making process negatively
- **sexism, hate-speech etc.**
