The collective attention of the participants is a limited resource.

### Debate Bounty
To start a new debate, the author of the root argument has to place a bounty in ETH or DAI
that can be earned by participants adding important arguments to the debate.

### Liquidity Provision by Authors
To create a node, a debater has to provide a fixed amount of his debate tokens as liquidity.
This alone prevents spamming and duplication attacks

This liquidity is used to set up a [rating market](ratingmarkets.md) later in the [rating phase](rating.md).
