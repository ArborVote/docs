Five stakeholder types participate in ArborVote:

## 🧝 Creator
The creator opens the debate, chooses parameters, 
and creates the statement forming the root node of the debate tree.

## 🧑‍🏫 Debaters
Debaters author arguments or fact nodes and add them to the debate tree.

## 👮 Curators
Curators can flag and propose edits to the content that authors can accept or reject.

## 🧑‍⚖ Jurors 
In the latter case, a dispute is raised that is resolved by jurors in a digital court.

## 🙋 Voters
Lastly, voters can invest debate tokens to rate the impact of nodes in the debate tree.
