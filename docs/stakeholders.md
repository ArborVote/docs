Four stakeholder types participate in the ArborVote decision-making process:

1. debaters
2. curators
3. jurors
4. voters

## Debaters
Debaters author arguments or fact nodes and add them to the debate tree.

## Curators
Curators can flag and propose edits to the content that authors can accept or reject.

## Jurors
In the latter case, a dispute is raised that is resolved by jurors in a digital court.

## Voters
Lastly, voters can invest debate tokens to rate the impact of nodes in the debate tree.
